## Author's comments

* About the License
As I mentionned in my previous submissions, the license CeCILL-C is of the same family as the CeCILL license and is fully compatible with the FSF's LGPL license (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeCILL).
I really don't understand why submission would be rejected for that reason.

* This is a new release.

* This is a first submission and the package doesn't have any downstream dependencies yet.
